Oh-woah, yeah!

I've been looking so long for you now
You won't get away from my grasp
You've been living so long in hiding
And hiding behind that false mask
And you know that I know that you ain't got that long to last
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past

You're standing in the wings there, you wait for the curtain to fall
And knowing the terror and holding you have on us all
Now, I know that you're gonna
Scratch me and maim me and maul
And you know I'm helpless from your mesmerising catcall
Ooh

Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait
Don't you stray, don't fade away, yeah
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may
Don't you stray from the narrow way, yeah



I'm running and hiding, in my dreams, you're always there
You're the Phantom of the Opera
You're the devil, you're just out to scare
You damaged my mind and my soul, it just floats through the air
You haunt me, you taunt me, you torture me back at your lair

Torture me back at your lair
