Alright

We're scannin' the scene in the city tonight
We're lookin' for you to start up the fight
There's an evil feeling in our brains
But it's nothin' new, you know it drives us insane

Runnin', on our way
Hidin', you will pay
Dyin', one thousand deaths
Runnin', on our way
Hidin', you will pay
Dyin', one thousand deaths

Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy

There is no escape and that's for sure
This is the end, we won't take any more
Say goodbye to the world you live in
You always been takin' and now you're givin'

Runnin', on our way
Hidin', you will pay
Dyin', one thousand deaths
Runnin', on our way
Hidin', you will pay
Dyin', one thousand deaths

Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy




Our brains are on fire with the feelin' to kill
And it won't go away until our dreams are fulfilled
There is only one thing on our minds
Don't try runnin' away, 'cause you're the one we will find

Runnin', on our way
Hidin', you will pay
Dyin', one thousand deaths
Runnin', on our way
Hidin', you will pay
Dyin', one thousand deaths

Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy
Searchin', seek and destroy, aha-ha-ha-ha
