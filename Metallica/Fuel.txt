Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire, ooh

Yeah
Turn on, I see red
Adrenaline crash and crack my head
Nitro junkie, paint me dead
And I see red
A hundred plus through black and white
War horse, warhead
Fuck 'em man, white-knuckle tight
Through black and white

Ooh, on I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

So gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire
Yeah

Turn on beyond the bone
Swallow future, spit out home
Burn your face upon the chrome
Yeah, oh, yeah
Take the corner, join the crash-ah
Headlights (Head on), headlines
Another junkie lives too fast
Yeah, lives way too fast (Fast)
Fast (Fast), fast (Fast), oh-oh

Ooh, on I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And on I burn
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

So gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire
Ooh, yeah-hey


White knuckle tight


Give me fuel (On I burn, on and on)
Give me fire (On I burn, on and on)
My desire (On I burn, on and on)

Ooh, on I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard, loose and clean
And on and on
Churning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline

Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire, ooh

On I burn
