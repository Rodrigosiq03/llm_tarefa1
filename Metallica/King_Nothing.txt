Wish I may, wish I might have this I wish tonight
Are you satisfied?
Dig for gold, dig for fame, you dig to make your name
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

Then it all crashes down and you break your crown
And you point your finger, but there's no one around
Just want one thing, just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled, and you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Where's your crown?

Hot and cold, bought and sold, a heart as hard as gold
Yeah, are you satisfied?
Wish I might, wish I may, you wish your life away
Are you pacified?

All the wants you waste
All the things you've chased

Then it all crashes down and you break your crown
And you point your finger, but there's no one around
Just want one thing, just to play the king, a-ha
But the castle's crumbled, and you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
Oh, nothin'
Oh, where's your crown?

Huh

I wish I may, I wish I might
Have this wish I wish tonight
I want that star, I want it now
I want it all and I don't care how
Careful what you wish
Careful what you say
Careful what you wish, you may regret it
Careful what you wish, you just might get it

Then it all crashes down and you break your crown
And you point your finger, but there's no one around
Just want one thing, just to play the king
But the castle's crumbled, and you're left with just a name
Where's your crown, King Nothing?

Nothin'
No, you're just nothin'
Where's your crown, King Nothing?
No, you're just nothin'
Absolutely nothin'
Off to never-never land
